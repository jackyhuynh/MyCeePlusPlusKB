# My C++ Knowledge Base

Welcome to our knowledge base! My goal is to spend less time and accomplish more. I've included all the essential
information needed to understand data structure utilization.
Hereâ€™s a refined version of your outline for clarity and structure:

+ **Part I: Data Structures**  
  Focus on the most commonly used data structures and their applications, explore the Standard Template Library (STL),
  and reinforce foundational C++ syntax and best practices.

+ **Part II: Design Patterns**  
  Introduce and implement popular design patterns in C++ for solving common software design challenges, emphasizing best
  practices and use cases.

+ **Part III: Advanced C++ & Deployment**  
  Apply advanced C++ features in real-world scenarios, combining data structures and design patterns. Discuss deployment
  strategies, including optimizing code for production environments and best practices for efficient deployment.

+ **Part IV: Robotic**
  Robotic Design and Development.
  
+ **Part V: Use Case**
  C++ applications.

## Getting Started

Please review the sections below and complete the tasks at the bottom of this page for course orientation.

## Text and Teaching Materials

- **Textbook:** It is required by ACC. I don't require it, but it is recommended.
- Most of my teaching material will be in this repository.
- I will do white board for concept explanation.
- What it mean to be a software engineer? How to search for topic?
- Why data structure is important in Software development?

## Quizzes and Web Assignment

- **Assignments and Quizzes:** These will be administered through GitHub Classroom.
- **Attendance:** While highly recommended, attendance is not mandatory.
- **Tests:** All tests will be conducted on Blackboard.

## Course Requirements

- **Orientation:** Mandatory. Failure to complete will result in being dropped from the class. Please do **both** the
  form and the quiz
- **Class Progress:** Regular progress is crucial as each concept builds on the previous ones. Regularly check grades in
  Blackboard.
- **Assignments:** Grades based on concept mastery and practical application. Includes exams, exercises, discussions,
  and programming assignments. Lab assignments allow a two-day grace period post-due date with a 20% penalty.
- **Exams:** Must be taken during assigned dates. Online students will use Blackboard from home; classroom students will
  take exams in class.

## Instructor Communication Plan

- Weekly announcements with reminders, tasks, and encouragement.
- Feedback on exams, discussions, and lab assignments within five days.
- Immediate quiz feedback via auto-grading.

## Technology Requirements

1. Access to a Windows or Mac computer for home testing.
2. Reliable internet access.

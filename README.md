# My C++ Knowledge Base

Welcome to our knowledge base! My goal is to spend less time and accomplish more. I've included all the essential
information needed to understand data structure utilization.
Here’s a refined version of your outline for clarity and structure:

+ **Part 0: Fundamentals**  
  Introduction to the C++ programming language and its subset, the C programming language.  Program structure, block, storage types, console and file I/O, functions, arrays,  strings, pointers, call-by-reference, call-by-value, and dynamic memory allocation.
  
+ **Part I: Data Structures**  
  Focus on the most commonly used data structures and their applications, explore the Standard Template Library (STL),
  and reinforce foundational C++ syntax and best practices.

+ **Part II: Design Patterns**  
  Introduce and implement popular design patterns in C++ for solving common software design challenges, emphasizing best
  practices and use cases.

+ **Part III: Advanced C++ & Deployment**  
  Apply advanced C++ features in real-world scenarios, combining data structures and design patterns. Discuss deployment
  strategies, including optimizing code for production environments and best practices for efficient deployment.

+ **Part IV: Robotic**
  Robotic Design and Development.
  
+ **Part V: Use Case**
  Some popular C++ applications.

+ **Part VI: Machine Language**
  How the Operating System organizes and works

## C++ Development Environment Setup

I use C++ for seasonal programming projects.

- C++ IDLE: any IDLE for your convenience, I am using Visual Studio Code and CLion, but many are out there.
    - My setup is:
        - Hardware: Mac OS X 16 GB, M3 Pro
        - Visual Studio Code
        - Python3
        - Jupiter Lab
        - Gcc/G++ for compiling C++
        - GitHub for version control
        - Oh My Zsh command line
        - Basic Linux
        - Homebrew
        - Markdown
    - My practice:
        - Agile
        - Unit Test

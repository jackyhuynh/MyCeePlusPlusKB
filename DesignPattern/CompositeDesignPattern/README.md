### **Composite Design Pattern in C++: Concept, Implementation, and Use Case**

---

The **Composite Design Pattern** is a **structural pattern** that allows you to treat a group of objects (composites) and individual objects (leaf nodes) in the same way. It composes objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern simplifies the client code by providing a **uniform interface** to interact with both individual objects and composites.

---

## **When to Use the Composite Pattern**

- When you have a **hierarchical structure** like files and folders, where both individual items and groups of items need to be treated uniformly.
- When you want **clients to interact with individual objects and groups of objects the same way**.
- When you need a **tree structure** to represent complex objects.

## **Implementation of the Composite Pattern in C++**

Let’s consider a **file system** as a use case. In this example, both **files** and **folders** need to implement the same interface so that clients can interact with them uniformly.

---

### **C++ Code Example: Composite Pattern**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <memory>
#include <string>

// Component: The base interface for both leaf and composite objects.
class FileSystemComponent {
public:
    virtual void display(int depth = 0) const = 0;
    virtual ~FileSystemComponent() = default;
};

// Leaf: Represents individual files in the system.
class File : public FileSystemComponent {
private:
    std::string name;

public:
    explicit File(const std::string& fileName) : name(fileName) {}

    void display(int depth = 0) const override {
        std::cout << std::string(depth, '-') << "File: " << name << std::endl;
    }
};

// Composite: Represents folders that contain files or other folders.
class Folder : public FileSystemComponent {
private:
    std::string name;
    std::vector<std::shared_ptr<FileSystemComponent>> children;

public:
    explicit Folder(const std::string& folderName) : name(folderName) {}

    void add(const std::shared_ptr<FileSystemComponent>& component) {
        children.push_back(component);
    }

    void display(int depth = 0) const override {
        std::cout << std::string(depth, '-') << "Folder: " << name << std::endl;
        for (const auto& child : children) {
            child->display(depth + 2);  // Indent child elements for clarity.
        }
    }
};

// Client Code: Works with the composite structure uniformly.
void clientCode(const FileSystemComponent& component) {
    component.display();
}

int main() {
    // Create individual files (leaves)
    auto file1 = std::make_shared<File>("file1.txt");
    auto file2 = std::make_shared<File>("file2.txt");
    auto file3 = std::make_shared<File>("file3.txt");

    // Create folders (composites)
    auto folder1 = std::make_shared<Folder>("Folder1");
    auto folder2 = std::make_shared<Folder>("Folder2");

    // Build the composite structure
    folder1->add(file1);
    folder1->add(file2);
    folder2->add(file3);
    folder1->add(folder2);  // Folder1 contains Folder2.

    // Use client code to display the structure
    std::cout << "File System Structure:" << std::endl;
    clientCode(*folder1);

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of the Code**

1. **FileSystemComponent (Component Interface):**  
   - This is the base interface that both **files** (leaves) and **folders** (composites) implement. It defines a `display()` method, which must be implemented by all subclasses.

2. **File (Leaf):**  
   - This class represents an individual file in the system. It overrides the `display()` method to print the file's name.

3. **Folder (Composite):**  
   - This class represents a folder that can contain files or other folders. It maintains a list of child components and implements the `display()` method to print its contents recursively.

4. **Client Code:**  
   - The client interacts with both **individual files** and **folders** through the same interface (`FileSystemComponent`). The client doesn’t need to know whether it is dealing with a file or a folder—it treats them uniformly.

### **Output of the Program**

```
File System Structure:
Folder: Folder1
--File: file1.txt
--File: file2.txt
--Folder: Folder2
----File: file3.txt
```

---

### **How the Composite Pattern Works in This Scenario**

- **Folders and files share a common interface.** Both individual files and folders implement the `FileSystemComponent` interface, allowing them to be treated uniformly.
- **Folders (composites) can contain other folders or files.** This allows you to build a tree-like structure with nested components.
- **The client interacts with the structure through the common interface.** The client doesn’t need to differentiate between individual files and folders.

---

### **Benefits of the Composite Pattern**

1. **Uniformity:** Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly.
2. **Scalability:** Makes it easy to add new components (files or folders) without changing existing code.
3. **Simplicity:** Reduces client code complexity by hiding the differences between individual and composite objects.

---

### **When to Use the Composite Pattern**

- When you have a **tree structure** and need to work with individual and composite objects in the same way.
- When you need a **hierarchical structure**, such as a **file system**, **organization chart**, or **UI components**.
- When you want to **avoid complex conditionals** in the client code to handle different types of objects.

---

### **Summary**

The **Composite Design Pattern** provides a way to treat individual objects and collections of objects uniformly. In this example, we implemented a **file system** where both **files** and **folders** are treated uniformly through a common interface. The **Composite Pattern** makes it easy to add, display, and manage complex hierarchical structures without changing the client code.

This pattern is especially useful in systems where objects need to be represented in **nested or recursive hierarchies**, such as a **graphical UI** or **file system explorer**.

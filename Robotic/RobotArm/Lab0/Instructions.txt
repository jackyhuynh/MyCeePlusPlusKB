Robot 90 Instructions


The robot can rotate to four specific degrees:

	0/360
	90
	180
	270

	
A command to the robot consists of three op codes.  See below for technical details:

	1.	Off/On.
	2.	Speed low or high.
	3.	Degree to rotate to.

	
The opcodes are sent one at a time to the robot, followed by the execute command:

	Send:
		opcode:	Off/On
		opcode:	Low/High
		opcode:	90/180/270/360
		opcode:	Execute
		
The commands are send in a command queue to the robot, where more than one command can be queued at a time.

Other notes:

These files are to be used on non-Windows C++ compilers.  The
code is supplied 'as-is', meaning if it doesn't work or compile, the
author is not responsible for fixing the problems found.  Every
effort has been made to use standard portable C++ code.

The author does not have a non-Windows C++ compiler, so 
cannot be expected to make it work on non-Windows operating
systems or compilers.

Adding a DLL to a VC++ Project

1.	Create a VS2013 Win32 Console application.
2.	Copy the Robot.cpp, RobotDLL.h, RobotDLL.lib to the directory where the Win32 .CPP file was created.
3.	Delete the 'projectname'.cpp file and rename Robot.cpp 'projectname'.cpp.  For example, if your project name was 'ABC', delete the ABC.cpp file and rename TestDLL.cpp ABC.cpp.
4.	Try to build the project.  You will get 2 linker errors involving unresolved external symbols.
5.	Open the Project file Properties:  Configuration Properties > C/C++ > Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies.
6.	Add:  RobotDLL.lib to the list (i.e. should already contain - %(AdditionalDependencies))
7.	Click the 'Apply' button, then OK.
8.	Rebuild the project, and you should get no errors.
9.	Run the Robot!

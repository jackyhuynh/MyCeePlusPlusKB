**Exam 1 Review** 

### 1. **Abstract Data Type (ADT)**
   - **Question:** What do the specifications of an ADT's operations indicate? (interface, headerfile)
   - **Key Concept:** Understand that ADT specifications describe *what* the operations do, not how they are implemented.

### 2. **Interfaces in Programming**
   - **Question:** A(n) ______ allows two modules to communicate with each other.
   - **Key Concept:** Learn that **interfaces** provide a communication pathway between modules without needing to know the implementation details.

### 3. **C++ Class**
   - **Question:** A(n) ______ is a C++ construct that enables a programmer to define a new data type.
   - **Key Concept:** Focus on the **class** concept and how it encapsulates data and methods.

### 4. **C++ Class Components**
   - **Question:** What are the components of a C++ class?
   - **Key Concept:** Review the distinction between data members (fields) and methods (functions) in C++.

### 5. **Objects in C++**
   - **Question:** What is an instance of a class called?
   - **Key Concept:** Understand that an **object** is a concrete instance of a class in C++.

### 6. **Abstract Data Type (ADT) Bag**
   - **Question:** What must a programmer know about ADT Bag to use it?
   - **Key Concept:** Emphasize knowing the **interface** of the bag, not the implementation.

### 7. **Recursion**
   - **Question:** What terminates recursive processing?
   - **Key Concept:** A **base case** is the condition that stops the recursion.

### 8. **Link-Based Implementation**
   - **Question:** In a link-based implementation, what node do we have direct access to?
   - **Key Concept:** In linked lists, we have direct access only to the first node.

### 9. **Shallow Copy vs. Deep Copy**
   - **Question:** When copying an object involves only copying the values of its data members, the copy is called a ______.
   - **Key Concept:** A *shallow copy* just copies data members, while a deep copy duplicates the object’s referenced objects as well.

### 10. **Link-Based Implementation Advantage**
   - **Question:** What is a key reason for using a link-based implementation of a bag?
   - **Key Concept:** Focus on the flexibility of a linked list that doesn’t have a fixed size.

### 11. **Infix Expressions**
   - **Question:** In what type of expression does an operator come between its operands?
   - **Key Concept:** Review *infix* notation, where the operator is between operands.

### 12. **Recursive Function without Base Case**
   - **Question:** What happens if a recursive function never reaches a base case?
   - **Key Concept:** A recursive function without a base case results in infinite recursion and will eventually cause the program to abort.

### 13. **Module Cohesion**
   - **Question:** When a module performs one well-defined task, we say that it is ______.
   - **Key Concept:** A *cohesive* module focuses on a single task.

### 14. **Modules**
   - **Question:** Which of the following is not a module?
   - **Key Concept:** A *data member* is part of a class but isn’t considered a standalone module.

### 15. **C++ Class Creation (Essay)**
   - **Question:** Write a C++ class called `InventoryItem` with specific member functions.
   - **Key Concept:** Practice writing C++ class definitions and method prototypes, understanding accessors, mutators, and how to handle encapsulation properly.

### 16. **ArrayBag Display Method (Essay)**
   - **Question:** Implement a display method for the `ArrayBag` class template.
   - **Key Concept:** Learn how to iterate over an array and display its contents within a class.

### 17. **ArrayBag Declaration (Essay)**
   - **Question:** Write the declaration of an `ArrayBag` object for integers and add an element.
   - **Key Concept:** Practice working with class templates and their specific type instantiations in C++.

### 18. **Dynamic Memory Allocation (Essay)**
   - **Question:** Dynamically allocate an `ArrayBag` object and store its address in a pointer.
   - **Key Concept:** Review dynamic memory allocation and the use of pointers in C++.

### 19. **Recursive Function Analysis (Essay)**
   - **Question:** Analyze the recursive function provided.
   - **Key Concept:** Understand how recursion works, identify base and recursive cases, and trace the function's behavior.

### 20. **Node Class and Linked List Manipulation (Essay)**
   - **Question:** Remove the first node from a linked list and free the memory used by that node.
   - **Key Concept:** Learn how to manipulate linked lists in C++, including proper memory management.

### 21. **ArrayBag Entry Storage (Essay)**
   - **Question:** Where are entries stored in the `ArrayBag`?
   - **Key Concept:** Understand the internal structure of the `ArrayBag` class and where items are stored.

### 22. **Error Handling**
   - **Question:** According to the textbook, what is a good way to handle an unusual condition detected in a method?
   - **Key Concept:** Review how to handle errors by returning error values or throwing exceptions.

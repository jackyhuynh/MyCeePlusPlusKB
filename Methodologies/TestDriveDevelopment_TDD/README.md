## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Test-Driven Development is a software development methodology where you write tests before writing the actual implementation code. The process follows a simple cycle known as "Red-Green-Refactor":

1. **Red**: Write a failing test that describes the desired functionality
2. **Green**: Write the minimal code necessary to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while keeping tests passing

The key principle is that tests drive the design and implementation of your code, ensuring better coverage, cleaner interfaces, and more maintainable software.

## C++ TDD Example

Here's a practical example implementing a simple `Calculator` class using TDD with Google Test framework:## Key TDD Benefits Demonstrated

**Better Design**: Writing tests first forces you to think about the interface before implementation, leading to cleaner APIs.

**Comprehensive Coverage**: Each piece of functionality is tested because tests come first.

**Regression Protection**: Any changes that break existing functionality are caught immediately.

**Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of how the code should behave.

**Confidence in Refactoring**: You can safely improve code knowing tests will catch any breaking changes.

## TDD Workflow in Practice

1. **Write the test** for the next small piece of functionality
2. **Run the test** - it should fail (RED)
3. **Write minimal code** to make the test pass (GREEN)  
4. **Run all tests** to ensure nothing broke
5. **Refactor** the code while keeping tests green
6. **Repeat** for the next feature

The examples show how TDD naturally leads to better error handling, edge case consideration, and cleaner interfaces. Each test case was written before the corresponding implementation, driving the design decisions.

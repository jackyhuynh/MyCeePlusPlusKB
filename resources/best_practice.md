# Personal Experience Regarding Best Practices in Software Development - CODE

## Ethic

- As a software engineer, you should act in the public interest, producing **high-quality and secure** software while
  maintaining honesty and integrity.
- **Protect confidential information**, respect intellectual property, and ensure your work is fair and *
  *non-discriminatory**.
- Continuously learn to stay professionally competent and comply with **relevant laws and regulations**.
- Collaborate and respect your colleagues, and consider the broader societal impacts of your work.

## Integrity

- **Do Not Cheat on Yourself**: Always strive for personal honesty in your work. Avoid shortcuts that compromise your
  learning or the quality of your code.

## Leveraging Tools

- **Leverage LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) Wisely**: Use language models and AI tools to assist your development, but do not
  become overly dependent on them. Develop your problem-solving skills and understanding.

## Avoiding Shortcuts

- **Avoid Being a 'Copy and Paste' Developer**: Do not rely solely on copying and pasting code from online sources. Take
  the time to understand the code you use and write your own when possible.

## Learning Approach

- **Be a Student, Not Just a Follower**: Approach every project as a learning opportunity. Engage actively with new
  concepts and technologies rather than just following instructions blindly.
- **Understand the Logic Behind Actions**: Focus on comprehending the reasoning and principles behind what you are
  doing. Avoid memorizing code; instead, grasp the concepts and logic that drive the coding process. For example, rather
  than memorizing a specific algorithm, understand why it works and when to apply it.
- Do not afraid to ask, there is no stupid questions

## Problem-Solving Mindset

- **View Problems as Challenges**: Adopt a mindset that sees problems as opportunities to learn and grow. Embrace
  challenges and work through them methodically.

## Flexibility

- **Do Not Restrict Yourself to Any One Technology Stack**: Be open to learning and using different technologies and
  tools. Flexibility will make you a more versatile and capable developer.

## Collaboration

- **Collaborate Effectively**: Work well with others, share knowledge, and contribute to team efforts. Good
  collaboration enhances the quality of projects and fosters a supportive learning environment.

## Personal Responsibility

- **Take Responsibility for Your Learning**: Be proactive in seeking knowledge and improving your skills. Set personal
  goals and strive to achieve them through continuous learning and practice.

## Problem Understanding

- **Understand the Story and Specific Problem You Are Trying to Solve**: Before jumping into coding, take the time to
  fully grasp the context and specifics of the problem at hand. This understanding is crucial for developing effective
  and efficient solutions.

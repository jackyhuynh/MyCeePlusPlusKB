# Exercises

### Exercise 1: Sum of a Range

Write a program that asks the user to enter a positive integer. Using a `for` loop, calculate the sum of all integers
from 1 up to the number entered by the user. Print the final sum to the console. Make sure to use a loop for the
calculation.

-----

### Exercise 2: Input Validation Loop

Create a program that prompts the user to enter a number between 1 and 100. Use a `while` loop to validate the input. If
the user enters a number outside of this range, display an error message and prompt them to enter the number again. Once
a valid number is entered, print a confirmation message and end the program.

-----

### Exercise 3: Simple Guessing Game

Modify the random number game from a previous chapter. Your new program should generate a random number between 1 and
10. The user then has to guess the number. Use a `do-while` loop to allow the user to keep guessing until they get the
number correct. After each incorrect guess, tell the user if their guess was too high or too low.

-----

### Exercise 4: Running Total

Write a program that calculates a running total of numbers entered by the user. The program should continue to ask for
numbers until the user enters a specific sentinel value, such as `-1`. After the user enters the sentinel, display the
total sum of all the valid numbers entered.

-----

### Exercise 5: Multiplication Table

Use nested `for` loops to create and display a multiplication table from 1 to 10. The output should be formatted neatly
in a grid. The outer loop should iterate through the rows, and the inner loop should iterate through the columns.

**Example Output (Partial):**

```
1   2   3   4   ...
2   4   6   8   ...
3   6   9   12  ...
...
```

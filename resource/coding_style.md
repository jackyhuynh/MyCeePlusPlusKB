# COSC 1336 Program Documentation and Style Requirements

Ensuring your code is professionally styled is crucial in this course. Here's a summary of the documentation and style requirements that will influence 20% of your grade for each programming assignment:

- **Initial Comment**: Start each program with a comment that includes:
  - Your name.
  - Program status: "Complete" or details of incomplete/non-functioning parts.
  - A brief description (1-3 lines) of the program's purpose.

- **Descriptive Comments**: Add comments to explain calculations or complex code segments.

- **Variable Names**: Choose clear and meaningful variable names, avoiding vague one or two-letter names.

- **Global Constants**: Use global constants instead of hard-coded numeric literals unless specified otherwise.

- **No Global Variables**: Refrain from using global variables in your program.

- **Labeled Output**: Ensure all outputs to the screen are correctly labeled, e.g., `print('Gross Pay is:', gross_pay)`.

- **Formatted Numeric Output**: Format all numeric outputs appropriately, such as using accounting format for dollar amounts.

- **Main Function**: From Chapter 5 onwards:
  - Include a main function at the beginning of the program, followed by sub-functions if needed.
  - Begin each function with a short comment describing its functionality (1-3 lines).

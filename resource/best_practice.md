# Personal Experience Regarding Best Practices in Software Development - CODE

## Ethic
- As a software engineer, you should act in the public interest, producing **high-quality and secure** software while maintaining honesty and integrity. 
- **Protect confidential information**, respect intellectual property, and ensure your work is fair and **non-discriminatory**. 
- Continuously learn to stay professionally competent and comply with **relevant laws and regulations**. 
- Collaborate and respect your colleagues, and consider the broader societal impacts of your work.

## Integrity
- **Do Not Cheat on Yourself**: Always strive for personal honesty in your work. Avoid shortcuts that compromise your learning or the quality of your code.

## Leveraging Tools
- **Leverage LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) Wisely**: Use language models and AI tools to assist your development, but do not become overly dependent on them. Develop your problem-solving skills and understanding.

## Avoiding Shortcuts
- **Avoid Being a 'Copy and Paste' Developer**: Do not rely solely on copying and pasting code from online sources. Take the time to understand the code you use and write your own when possible.

## Learning Approach
- **Be a Student, Not Just a Follower**: Approach every project as a learning opportunity. Engage actively with new concepts and technologies rather than just following instructions blindly.
- **Understand the Logic Behind Actions**: Focus on comprehending the reasoning and principles behind what you are doing. Avoid memorizing code; instead, grasp the concepts and logic that drive the coding process. For example, rather than memorizing a specific algorithm, understand why it works and when to apply it.
- Do not afraid to ask, there is no stupid questions

## Problem-Solving Mindset
- **View Problems as Challenges**: Adopt a mindset that sees problems as opportunities to learn and grow. Embrace challenges and work through them methodically.

## Flexibility
- **Do Not Restrict Yourself to Any One Technology Stack**: Be open to learning and using different technologies and tools. Flexibility will make you a more versatile and capable developer.

## Collaboration
- **Collaborate Effectively**: Work well with others, share knowledge, and contribute to team efforts. Good collaboration enhances the quality of projects and fosters a supportive learning environment.

## Personal Responsibility
- **Take Responsibility for Your Learning**: Be proactive in seeking knowledge and improving your skills. Set personal goals and strive to achieve them through continuous learning and practice.

## Problem Understanding
- **Understand the Story and Specific Problem You Are Trying to Solve**: Before jumping into coding, take the time to fully grasp the context and specifics of the problem at hand. This understanding is crucial for developing effective and efficient solutions.

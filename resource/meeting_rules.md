# COSC Meeting Rules

## Sharing
- Be open and respectful when sharing ideas and opinions.
- Encourage others to contribute and share their perspectives.

## Collaboration
- Work together to solve problems and complete tasks.
- Support your classmates and foster a team-oriented environment.
- **Popcorn Participation**: In this class, we will use a "popcorn" method for participation. This means that after one person speaks, they will call on another person to continue the discussion. This encourages active engagement and ensures everyone has a chance to contribute.
- Each participant will have a change to read during the session
- **Use Discord** as the main communication channel. Please don't be afraid to ask questions publicly. There are no stupid questions; we need to embrace learning. 
Asking questions in public encourages quicker responses from your instructor and benefits everyone.

## Language
- Please use professional and respectful language at all times.
- Avoid slang, inappropriate jokes, and offensive comments.

## Learning
- Focus on learning and understanding the material for your future benefit.
- Ask questions and seek help when needed to enhance your understanding.

## Camera
- Please turn on your camera, especially when you are speaking.
- Engage with the class and participate actively. I will treat you as an adult and expect professional behavior.

# Linked List

## Sample Code
```
# Sample command to run these code in this directory
# Check current working directory
pwd         
# Output: /Users/truchuynh/Documents/Projects/cplus_sample_code

# move to the actual source code
cd source/2_LinkedList

# Output: all the file in the current directory
ls          
 
# run this for the unit test (replace output_file_name with the name that you want your file)
g++ DoubleLinkedListTests.cpp DoubleLinkedList.cpp -o output_file_name

# run this for the main test
g++ main.cpp DoubleLinkedList.cpp -o main

```
## Diffrent kind of linked-list

A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next element in the sequence. There are three main types of linked lists: single linked list, doubly linked list, and circular linked list.

## Single Linked List:

- In a single linked list, each element (node) contains a data element and a link (pointer/reference) to the next node in the sequence.
- It only allows traversal in one direction, from the head (first element) to the tail (last element).
- It is a simple and memory-efficient data structure, but it doesn't allow easy traversal in reverse order.
## Doubly Linked List:

- In a doubly linked list, each node has a data element and two links: one pointing to the next node and another pointing to the previous node.
- It allows traversal in both directions: forward and backward.
- Because of the additional backward links, a doubly linked list typically uses more memory than a single linked list.
- The presence of backward links makes operations like insertion and deletion at arbitrary positions more convenient.
## Circular Linked List:

- In a circular linked list, the last node's link points back to the first node, forming a loop or circle.
- It can be either a single circular linked list (each node points to the next node) or a doubly circular linked list (each node has both next and previous links).
- Circular linked lists are useful in certain scenarios, such as implementing circular buffers or managing tasks in a round-robin fashion.
- Traversal in a circular linked list involves iterating until the starting node is encountered again.

## In summary:

- Single Linked List: Forward-only traversal, memory-efficient.
- Doubly Linked List: Forward and backward traversal, more memory overhead.
- Circular Linked List: Forms a loop, can be single or doubly linked.
- The choice between these types of linked lists depends on the specific requirements of the problem you are trying to solve. Each type has its own advantages and trade-offs in terms of memory usage, ease of implementation, and efficiency of various operations.

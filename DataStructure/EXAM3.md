## **Exam3 Review**

1. **Question**: Explain why algorithm efficiency, measured in Big-O notation, is generally a concern. What types of
   problems benefit most from this analysis?

2. **Question**: Describe the worst-case time complexity of a binary search algorithm when searching a sorted array.
   What factors influence this complexity?

3. **Question**: Compare the time complexity of inserting an item into a SortedList ADT and a balanced binary search
   tree. What are the key differences?

4. **Question**: Discuss how the number of comparisons needed for a retrieval operation in a binary search tree can be
   determined. What structural aspect of the tree is most relevant to this comparison?

5. **Question**: Identify and explain an operation that is not typically part of the standard ADT Queue operations.
   Justify why it would or wouldnâ€™t be included.

6. **Question**: In a priority queue, what determines the order in which items are removed? Provide an example to
   illustrate this behavior.

7. **Question**: When designing a simple word processor that allows a user to backspace and correct typing errors, what
   ADT would you choose to implement this functionality? Explain your reasoning.

8. **Question**: Provide an example of a real-life scenario that can be modeled using a queue. How does this ADT reflect
   the behavior observed in your example?

9. **Question**: What is the Big-O worst-case time complexity of the sequential search algorithm? Describe a situation
   where this search method would be used and how the time complexity impacts performance.

10. **Question**: Explain the worst-case time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm. Discuss when using this sorting
    algorithm might still be appropriate despite its complexity.

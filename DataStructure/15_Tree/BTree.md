# Explanation of the C++ B-Tree Implementation

## Here's a breakdown of how this C++ code implements a B-tree:

### 1. BTreeNode Class

- Represents a single node in the B-tree.
- keys: Stores the actual data values within the node.  A node can hold multiple keys.
- children: Stores pointers to child nodes.  Non-leaf nodes have children.
- n: The current number of keys stored in the node.
- leaf: A boolean value indicating if this node is a leaf node (no children).
- t: The minimum degree of the B-tree.
- The constructor allocates memory for the keys and children arrays.
- The destructor deallocates this memory.

### 2. BTree Class

- Represents the entire B-tree data structure.
- root: Pointer to the root node of the B-tree.
- t: The minimum degree of the B-tree.  This is a crucial property that dictates the structure of the tree.
- The constructor initializes the root and minimum degree.
- The destructor destroyTree recursively deletes all nodes in the tree, freeing up memory.

### 3. Key Operations

#### Search:
 
- The search(int k) function initiates the search for a key k.
- The search(BTreeNode* node, int k) function recursively traverses the tree:
- It looks for k within the current node's keys.
- If found, the node is returned.
- If not found, and the node is a leaf, nullptr is returned (key not in the tree).
- If not found, and the node is not a leaf, the appropriate child node is selected based on the keys, and the search continues recursively.

#### Insert:

- The insert(int k) function inserts a key k into the B-tree.
- If the tree is empty, a new root node is created.
- If the root is full (has 2t - 1 keys), it's split using splitChild, and the new key is inserted into the appropriate resulting node.
- The insertNonFull(BTreeNode* x, int k) function inserts k into a non-full node x.
- If x is a leaf, the key is inserted in sorted order.
- If x is not a leaf, the correct child is found, and if that child is full, it's split before inserting.
- splitChild divides a full node y into two nodes.  The median key of y is moved to the parent node.

#### Delete:

- The deleteKey(int k) function deletes the key k from the B-Tree.
- The deleteKey(BTreeNode* x, int k) function recursively traverses the tree to find the key to delete.
- removeFromLeaf(BTreeNode* x, int index): Removes the key at index from the leaf node x.
- deleteFromNonLeaf(BTreeNode* x, int index, int k): Deletes a key from a non-leaf node x.
- getPred(BTreeNode* x, int index): Gets the predecessor of the key at the given index in x.
- getSucc(BTreeNode* x, int index): Gets the successor of the key at the given index in x.
- merge(BTreeNode* x, int index): Merges the child at index index of node x with its right sibling.
- fixChild(BTreeNode* x, int index): Fixes the child at index of node x to ensure it has at least t keys.
- borrowFromPrev(BTreeNode* x, int index): Borrows a key from the previous sibling.
- borrowFromNext(BTreeNode* x, int index): Borrows a key from the next sibling.

#### Print:

- The print() function prints the B-tree in inorder traversal, useful for debugging and visualization.
- The print(BTreeNode* node) function recursively prints the nodes of the tree.
- Get Minimum/Maximum:
- getMinimum() finds the smallest key in the B-tree by traversing to the leftmost leaf node.
- getMaximum() finds the largest key by traversing to the rightmost leaf node.

### 4. Main Function

- Creates a BTree object with a minimum degree of 3.
- Inserts a set of keys.
- Demonstrates searching, finding the minimum/maximum, and deleting keys.
- Prints the tree after various operations to show the B-tree's structure.
- B-Tree Properties
- Balanced: All paths from the root to the leaves have the same length.
- Minimum Degree t: A node (except the root) must have at least t - 1 keys and at most 2t - 1 keys.  This ensures good performance.
- Ordered: Keys within a node are in sorted order.
- Efficient: B-trees are designed for efficient disk access, making them suitable for databases and file systems.

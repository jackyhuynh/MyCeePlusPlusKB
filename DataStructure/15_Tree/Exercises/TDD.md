# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. It follows a short, iterative cycle known as "Red-Green-Refactor." Here's a breakdown:

**The TDD Cycle:**

* **Red:**
    * Write a test for a small piece of functionality.
    * Run the test. It should fail because the functionality doesn't exist yet.
* **Green:**
    * Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass.
    * Run the test again. It should now pass.
* **Refactor:**
    * Improve the code's structure, readability, and efficiency without changing its behavior.
    * Run all tests again to ensure no regressions were introduced.

**Key Principles:**

* **Write tests first:** This forces you to think about the desired behavior before implementation.
* **Small steps:** Focus on implementing small, incremental changes.
* **Frequent testing:** Run tests often to catch errors early.
* **Refactoring:** Continuously improve the code's design.

**Example in C++ (using a hypothetical simple example, and conceptual test code):**

Let's say we want to create a simple `Calculator` class with an `add` function.

**1. Red (Write a Failing Test):**

```c++
// Hypothetical test code (using a test framework like Google Test)
#include "gtest/gtest.h"
#include "calculator.h" // Assuming calculator.h will contain the class.

TEST(CalculatorTest, AddTwoNumbers) {
  Calculator calc;
  EXPECT_EQ(5, calc.add(2, 3)); // Test will fail initially.
}
```

**2. Green (Make the Test Pass):**

```c++
// calculator.h
class Calculator {
public:
  int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
  }
};
```

Now, the test will pass.

**3. Refactor (Improve the Code):**

In this simple example, there might not be much to refactor. However, if the `Calculator` class grew more complex, we could refactor it for better readability or efficiency.

**Important considerations:**

* For actual c++ TDD, using a testing framework like Google Test, or Catch2 is very important.
* TDD helps to create cleaner, more maintainable code.
* TDD can increase developer confidence.
